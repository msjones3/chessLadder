# chessLadder
distribution code for chessLadder assignment. Code is not necessarily the most efficient, does not do much in the way of error checking user-input, and does not feature permanent storage of data. It does give you an idea about how you might think about some of the logic involved in the project. 

## What you need to do
- You will need to add a permanent storage solution for the ranks so that we can close the program and reopen it without having to worry about the usernames or ranks being deleted
- Create a setup file that will be run by the administrator when setting up the ladder for the first time. This will create the sqlite database with the player table.
- Allow the administrator to add all usernames to the database for the first time using. Your program should randomly assign ranks to all users. 
- Adjust the main.py program so that any time a rank is changed, the database is updated. 
- Thoroughly test your code
- Design a user-interface with PySimpleGUI that is simple for the administrator and players to use. (Please make this as simple and intuitive for your user as possible)

## How to start
- Read through the code.
- Highlight the functions and annotate with their purpose.
- Draw a flowchart or sketch that shows how the database will be updated. 
- Draw a mockup/wireframe of your GUI
- Create a paper prototype of your GUI using the wireframes you created. Test your paper prototype on several test cases to see how it works. Ask your parents or other students (ideally those who are not in your DT class) to test it to see if they understand how it works without you needing to explain. 
- create the required database table(s)
- add the test data (insert)
- modify the code for SQL
- create the user interface
- evaluate your solution with regards to useability, efficiency of code, maintainability
